/**
 * The last line of defence for a screen nobody is standing in front of.
 *
 * React unmounts the whole tree when a render throws. Without something to
 * catch it that leaves a blank white page — no header, no message, no button —
 * and the only way back is for someone to know to reload a browser they can't
 * see the address bar of. On an iPad standing at the counter that is
 * the worst failure there is: it looks broken, it stays broken all day, and
 * nothing anywhere says what happened.
 *
 * So a crash gets a card instead, and one silent attempt to fix itself.
 *
 * WHY IT RELOADS ITSELF, AND WHY ONLY ONCE
 *
 * Most crashes here would be a one-off — a reply from the Sheet that
 * arrived in the wrong shape — and reloading clears them. Doing that
 * automatically means the iPad is usually working again before anyone walks
 * past. But a fault that happens on every render would then reload forever, so
 * the attempt is written down in sessionStorage first: one reload per tab, and
 * if it crashes again the card stays up and says so.
 *
 * sessionStorage, not localStorage, on purpose — it is emptied when the tab is
 * closed, so tomorrow's first crash is still allowed its own retry.
